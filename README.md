# HangOut - A fullstack clone of Meetup.com

## General Info

link to live site: https://my-meetup-clone.onrender.com

This is my first fullstack clone project completed at App Academy.
Technologies used:
    -Javascript and Node.js
    -React and Redux frontend
    -Express and Sequelize/PostGreSQL backend

### Features: 

Initial features let users:
- Create an account
- Create a "group"
- Edit/delete their group
- Create events related to their group
- Edit or delete events related to groups they have created
- View groups and events created by other users

### Roadmap: features to come

The next features I plan to implement will be:
- A profile page to view a user's information and groups
- A "membership" feature that lets users become members of different groups
- An "attendance" feature that lets users rsvp to events put on by groups they are members of
- A "venues" feature that allows groups and events to set locations, with the use of the Google Maps API

### Get Started

To set up the repo locally, clone the code link above into your local folder.
Run npm install in the terminal of the root directory, then in both the frontend and backend folders.
I am unsure of how detailed the information here should be so I will wait to finish this section.
